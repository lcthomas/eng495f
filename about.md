What happens to print literature in a digital age? A common answer to this question is that the print novel is dying: today, the narrative goes, people are reading fewer books because they are spending more time engaging with digital technologies. This course responds to this line of thinking by showing how contemporary print literature continues to revitalize itself in light of digital technologies. The course focuses on the intersections between print and digital, emphasizing works of literature that explicitly take on digital technologies and that ask us to refashion our understanding of these technologies’ relationship to literature.
