After spending five days tracking my usage of all forms of media, I can only conclude that, boy, did I underestimate the complexity of this project. After all, I thought, I&#8217;m an old newspaperman. I&#8217;ve blogged professionally, for pete&#8217;s sake! How hard can it be? Plenty, let me tell you. The task of analyzing my data with the aid of Tableau, or event Excel proved, after three hours of wild-eyed hair-pulling, utterly beyond me. I&#8217;m man enough to admit there were tears. My only recourse, then, was to tote up figures the old-fashioned way, on a piece of paper, biting my tongue in concentration, pencil and eraser in hand. God, do I hate math, one of the reasons I went into journalism.

As a result, I have only a rough calculation of the percentages of my use of various media, only a preliminary understanding of the data, and no pie chart to illustrate the many ways I waste–er, use–my time. I plan to struggle manfully with the techno demons after class, but for now, here is what I have.

In a broad overview, I spend approximately half my time consuming various media. I don&#8217;t mean half my waking hours, but half my total hours, or close to it. On Sept 2, my media-est day, I devoted 13.6 hours on media. My least media-centric day was Aug. 30, when I consumed media only 6.66 hours (I like to think of it as my &#8220;anti-Christ day&#8221;), but that includes the evening of my bi-weekly poker game, which takes up three and-alf hours. The other three days ranged from 9 to 11 to 12 hours, rounding the numbers to the nearest whole numbers. Wow. Those are words I haven&#8217;t used since 11th grade.

You might think a mature fellow such as myself, certainly no digital native, would be horrified by numbers like these. It seems media is consuming my life. Like a shark! The truth is, however, that I always consumed media in mass quantities. It&#8217;s only that up until about ten years ago, that media consisted of print newspapers and magazines, books, television, radio, CDs, and so forth. Much of the time I would have spent with print media now goes to the Internet, either on my iPhone or on my laptop. I get my daily news on my iPhone, more than anywhere else. I do almost all my work on the laptop, whether it&#8217;s schoolwork or writing freelance articles, or researching stories for pitches, or writing personal creative stuff. Until the late &#8217;90s, I would have done this same work in libraries, on the telephone, and in books. Until the late &#8217;80s, I worked on a typewriter.

So the general character of my media use has not changed. I use it for work, for research, for entertainment. In my business, lucky me, entertainment and research frequently overlap. For example, I spent several hours during the five days inducing in what I call &#8220;aimless web surfing,&#8221; which mostly consists of following hypertexts from one tasty and irresistible morsel of information to another. Lately I&#8217;ve been obsessed by mythology (an old interest in any case) and it takes but little to get me off reading about the ancient Greeks or Gilgamesh or Odin or Fionn mac Cumhaill (Finn McCool), or Siegfried or the ancient Scythians or the Bible or&#8230; you get the idea. Just last night, I couldn&#8217;t sleep, so at 2 a.m. I fired up the old iPhone and read the first five chapters of Genesis, King James Version. Sublime.

When I was younger I sometimes read encyclopedias this way, or even dictionaries, and I devoured magazines. The problem, with sight-seeing along the Information Highway is the ease with which I can get lost, diverted from the destination of productive work. I suppose that was always true. I used to read at least three newspapers, cover to cover, every day. But if my work and habits have not changed in substance, only in form, does that mean that the digitization of Chauncey Mabe has had no effect (or affect)? If only it were so. The fact is, for me, while digital technology really does put virtually all information ever produced at my fingertips, making me far more efficient in the researching, reporting, and writing of freelance stories, for example, it has eroded not only my satisfaction but also my peace of mind. True, it is much easier to Google a subject than it is to drive to the library, wandering the stacks, fingering the card catalogue, perhaps consulting a research librarian. But the pleasure of the task is immensely lessened. The darting speed of digital information, the hurry-hurry of hypertext, the agitated context of stories and information on a computer screen seem like some kind of damnation compared to the calm pleasures of library research. Let us pause for a moment in honor of research librarians, most of whom must be cashiered into jobs at Walmart by now. I never met a one who was not a kind of nerd saint. A search engine with a personality.

While I find digital media to be innervating and in many ways unrewarding, I do not share Ulin&#8217;s valorization of book reading. For one thing, people continue to read books. I find it one of the few media ready to hand that does not excite me in an unpleasant way. And I must confess that streaming media is a boon, even to me. I watch Netflix and Hulu, like everyone else. I try to learn Spanish on my Duolingo app. I always loved audio books, beginning back in the ancient era of cassette tapes, continuing through the CD age. Now I download audio books to my iPhone, and listen to them with ease and pleasure.

The digital revolution comes with its advantages and, to me, some serious disadvantages. It&#8217;s not going anywhere, I reluctantly acknowledge, so I&#8221;ll adapt as best I can. Print will always be my preferred choice for pleasure reading, and serious news, too. But I&#8217;m going to keep up with Mr. Robot on my iPhone as well.
