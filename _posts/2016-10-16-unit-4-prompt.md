## Due Date

Friday, October 28 by class

The Unit 4 blog post is designed to help you prepare for our second take-home exam. It has 2 parts.

## Part 1

You can choose from 2 options in completing this part of the blog post.

**Option A:**

This option is just like blog post 2. You will choose a specific pattern from EITHER _The People of Paper_ OR _Citizen_, and you will write a 500-750-word analysis of that pattern. See the <a href="http://lindsaythomas.net/eng495f/2016/09/07/unit-2-prompt/" target="_blank">unit 2 prompt</a> for the specifics about how to complete this post.

**Option B:**

If you choose this option, you will write a 500-750-word response to the following question: What is an “artist’s book,” and how are artist’s books different from so-called “experimental literature”?

You should incorporate at least 1 of the secondary sources we have read in Units 3 or 4 (Franzen, Marcus, Hong, Benjamin, Drucker), and at least 1 of the artist’s books we have examined in Unit 4 (Henderson, Tan, one of the books from special collections) into your answer. As always, be specific. I am not looking for general answers, summaries, or paraphrases here. Instead, I am looking for responses that use specific ideas/quotes from at least one of our secondary sources as a launching point for their own ideas, and that illustrate these ideas by referring to specific aspects of at least one artist’s book.

## Part 2: Exam Question

As with your Unit 2 blog post, in this part of your post, you will help me in formulating a potential question (or a series of related questions) for our second take-home exam. The exam format will be the same as our first take-home exam:

  * 3 shorter essay questions OR 1 long essay question (you will choose which format you want to complete)
  * 5-6 double-spaced pages (about 1600-2000 words)

You will help me to formulate the shorter essay questions. I will review the questions you submit and base the exam questions on those you submit, although I reserve the right to revise/reword/edit/expand on/combine and otherwise alter your initial questions. The final form the questions take will be up to my discretion. You will receive the exam questions for Exam 2 in class one week before the first take-home exam is due (Exam 2 is due Monday, Nov 7, so you will receive the questions on Monday, Oct 31).

The question or series of related questions you submit should focus on **one concept or idea** that we have covered in Units 3 and/or 4 of this course (in either/both the readings and/or class discussion), and on how that one concept or idea is discussed/enacted in **at least one of the texts we read in Units 3 and/or 4**. Your question should ask the examinee for what you consider to be a fair assessment of this material. Here are some general guidelines to follow:

  * Your question(s) should be answerable in about 500-750 words.
  * It should cover material from Units 3 and 4.
  * It should be as specific as possible. This means it should refer specifically to at least one text we have read in class, and to at least one concept/idea we have read about/discussed.
  * You might also think about putting two or more texts in dialogue with one another in some way (comparison/contrast, for example).
  * It should provide the opportunity for independent, creative and critical reflection and/or analysis. In other words, it should NOT be a yes/no type of question; in fact, it doesn’t necessarily need to have only one “right” answer. Nor should it be an opinion-based question (i.e., “Do you think x is a good idea/fair/unfair/etc? Why or why not?”).
  * Think about the short essay questions from Exam 1. What are they like? How might you structure your question like those?
